# TOP-Gingers-Landing-Page

This git repository was created to further train and apply lessons from the The Odin Project.
The main focus on this repository is to create a webpage using a photo reference as a guide.
Overall this was a fun and good real experince to basic web design.

## Personal comments

This webpage was redone fully part way through as I was not happy with the setup of the first version, 
I am happier with the look and setup of the second version which is currently up to date.

It must also be noted that alot of the content viewed is based on Command and Conquer game universe.
I have included a reserved rights to the owner of Command and Conquer (Electronic Arts) on the webpage footer.
This was made as a fun side project along side learning and following the The Odin Project I hope it turned out well.
